abstract: 'The Guiana dolphin (<i>Sotalia guianensis</i>) is a common species along Central and South American coastal waters. Although much efort has been made to understand its behavioral ecology and evolution, very little is known about its brain. The use of ultra-high feld MRI in anatomical descriptions of cetacean brains is a very promising approach that is still uncommon. In this study, we present for the frst time a full anatomical description of the Guiana dolphin’s brain based on high-resolution ultra-high-feld magnetic resonance imaging, providing an exceptional level of brain anatomical details, and enriching our understanding of the species. Brain structures were labeled and volumetric measurements were delineated for many distinguishable structures, including the gray matter and white matter of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, superior and inferior colliculi, thalamus, corpus callosum, ventricles, brainstem and cerebellum. Additionally, we provide the surface anatomy of the Guiana dolphin brain, including the labeling of main sulci and gyri as well as the calculation of its gyrifcation index. These neuroanatomical data, absent from the literature to date, will help disentangle the history behind cetacean brain evolution and consequently, mammalian evolution, representing a signifcant new source for future comparative studies.'
