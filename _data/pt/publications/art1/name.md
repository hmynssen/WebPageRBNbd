abstract: 'Brain reconstruction, specially of the cerebral cortex, is a challenging task and even more so when it comes to highly gyrified brained animals. Here, we present Stitcher, a novel tool capable of generating such surfaces utilizing MRI data and manual segmentation. Stitcher makes a triangulation between consecutive brain slice segmentations by recursively adding edges that minimize the total length and simultaneously avoid self-intersection. We applied this new method to build the cortical surfaces of two dolphins: Guiana dolphin (<em>Sotalia guianeneis</em>), Franciscana dolphin (<em>Pontoporia blainvillei</em>); and one pinniped: Steller Sea lion (<em>Eumetopias jubatus</em>). Specifically in the case of <em>P. blainvillei</em>, two reconstructions at two different resolutions were made. Additionally, we also performed reconstructions for sub- and non-cortical structures of Guiana dolphin. All our cortical mesh results shows remarkable resemblance with the real anatomy of the brains, except <em>P.blainvillei</em> with low-resolution data. Sub- and non-cortical meshes were also properly reconstructed and the spatial positioning of structures was preserved with respect to </em>S. guianensis</em> cerebral cortex. In a comparative perspective between methods, Stitcher presents compatible results for volumetric measurements when contrasted with other anatomical standard tools. In this way, Stitcher seems to be a viable pipeline for new neuroanatomical analysis, enhancing visualization and descriptions of non-primates species, and broadening the scope of compared neuroanatomy.'
